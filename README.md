# Meg-s-Portfolio
A basic personal portfolio website built from scratch during the TinkerSpace "Chill Build" session — my first fully self-made web project.
# Meghna Pradeep – Basic Portfolio Website

This is a simple, personalized portfolio website created from scratch as part of the **TinkerSpace "Chill Build" session** — an informal yet productive event where participants built and shared projects together.

Unlike my earlier portfolio made with a given template during the **She Builds Tech Portfolio Hub** program by Kerala Startup Mission, this version was developed entirely by me with no prior structure. It was a great learning experience in writing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript directly, organizing sections like About, Skills, Projects, Art, Blog, and Contact.

> ⏳ Due to time constraints, this portfolio includes only core features — but it gave me real confidence to build and improve my own site from scratch.
