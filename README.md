# Meg-s-Portfolio
A basic personal portfolio website built from scratch during the TinkerSpace "Chill Build" session — my first fully self-made web project.


# Meghna's Corner – Basic Portfolio Website(from scratch)

This is a **basic but personal portfolio website** built from scratch as part of the **"Chill Build" session by TinkerSpace** — a hands-on event where participants created simple projects in a casual, collaborative environment.

Unlike my earlier portfolio created using a pre-built template during the **She Builds Tech Portfolio Hub** by Kerala Startup Mission, this one was entirely coded by me without any starter files. I began with limited knowledge but a lot of curiosity, and by the end, I had a working site with custom sections that reflect who I am and what I love.

Despite time constraints, this project became a valuable learning experience in front-end development and gave me a strong foundation to build more complex sites in the future.
